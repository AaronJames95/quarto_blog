In DL we use *layered* models to do the same thing on more complicated data. \n",

We want to determine a way to use math to relate the inputs and the outputs of the data that we *do* have. If we can get that right on the data we *do* have, we can be relatively confident we can use it for *future predictions*. \n",

So 3D tensors that have an axis that contains all the digit data predictions together? Because the thing that's hard is the output should NOT be a number between 0 and 9.

    "### Stochastic Gradient Descent\n",
    "\n",
    "More fancy words to make simple things sound complicated. We talked earlier about the fact that \"learning\" means estimating the parameters of a model (math equation, function) that fits our dataset. How do we use a computer to estimate the parameters of a function? We use Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD). The [linked notebook](https://www.kaggle.com/code/jhoward/how-does-a-neural-net-really-work) goes into really good depth on what exactly this is. Before we start applying this step, we really need to decide on a model. We use a linear model in this notebook for our machine learning example because its one of the simplest models there is. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Steps for SGD\n",
    "0. **Decide on a model**: We have chosen the linear model $y = mx + b$\n",
    "1. **Initialize parameters**: We come up with some random guesses for our parameters $m$ and $b$.\n",
    "2. **Predict**: We use our data and our initial parameters to make a prediction. The first time we do this we will always have a very poor prediction.\n",
    "3. **Calculate the loss**: We haven't really talked about loss yet. We brushed on it in the last post. Basically, we need a numerical way of determining *how* wrong we are. We compared L1 norm and L2 norm (RMSE) in the last post, and it turned out that RMSE worked better for our dataset and current use case. Keep in mind that this is now *another* equation. Our model is about predicting the data, and our loss is about estimating the accuracy of our data. Two different equations. \n",
    "4. **Calculate the Gradient**. And here's the hardest math part. Again here's [Jeremy's SGD Post](https://www.kaggle.com/code/jhoward/how-does-a-neural-net-really-work). *Very basically*, we use calculus to determine how much each parameter needs to change so that when we make our next prediction, our loss is smaller. We can use these numerical methods so we *don't* have to make a random guess for our next estimate, it will be a very precise estimate based on the principles of multi-variate calculus.\n",
    "5. **Step the parameters**: We now adjust the parameters based on the gradient. We nudge them in the direction of a smaller loss that our previous gradients predicted.\n",
    "6. **Repeat the process with Step 2**. The two magic parts of this are the gradient, and the various iterations. If we can keep nudging out parameters in the right direction (with the gradient), and do it iteratively (step 6) eventually our loss will get closer and closer to zero. This is good. If loss is the difference between the prediction and the right answer, it will be very helpful if that distance is minimized\n",
    "7. **Stop**. We can't just iterate forever. We will likely have some imposed criteria that we will hit that will tell us we can stop. For example, we could iterate until we beat our baseline that we got in the last post. However we define it, we will have to stop at some point to be able to apply the learnings of our model\n",

    "1. **Initializing the parameters**: For binary classification, each image only needs one output which is essentially true/false to the question, \"is this image a zero?\". For multi-class, each image needs 10 different scores. We do this by changing our `weights` and `biases` initialization. They change from `weights, bias = init_params((28*28,1)), init_params(1)` to `weights, bias = init_params((28*28,10)), init_params(10)`. A note: all I had to do was add TWO ZEROES but this took me forever to figure out...\n",

Since I set my data up this way, we know that that index corresponds *exactly* to the labels we had in our \"correct answers\" data (y_label or targets). If I was classifying dog breeds, I'd have to come up with a different way of doing this, likely using a map that maps indices to the corresponding breed.

    "Ok so I realized that we needed another one. My plan was to determine which digit that the parameters predicted the image was, compare it to the correct target labels, and then get the average number of misses per batch as my loss function. Two issues with this. First was implementation. If I use argmax on the prediction variable, I lose gradient tracking of my parameters w and b. So our whole stochastic gradient descent method falls apart. Second was conceptual. If this did work somehow, I'm not being optimal. My model would treat these two classifications of a 6 the same:\n",

This training loop is the main engine that drives most ML systems and we just built it from scratch. Think about a car engine. There's no way I will ever need to build a car engine from scratch. If I'm building my own car, I might buy an engine, and knowledge of how it works will help me choose which to buy for the car I want to build. Most people will just end up buying the whole car and be blissfully unaware of the fact that it comes with a functioning engine. \n",

Instead of writing our own version of this, we want to use the one that is already provided. We also need an \"optimizer\", so that we mirror the factory more accurately."

    "Remember earlier we talked about the difference between ML and DL as using *layers* of models. The way we do this is to apply more than one model and separate those models with a non-linearity. So, more fancy words. If we had a function $y_1 = m_1 \\times x +b_1$ and another function $y_2 = m_2 \\times x+b_2$, we couldn't just add these two together and expect a different type of function. If we did, we would just get $y_{1+2} = m_{1+2} \\times x+b_{1+2}$. The problem is that the model doesn't care about the difference between $m_1$ and $m_2$; it just see weights and a bias. \n",
    "\n",
    "We can *separate* these models with something like a Recitified Linear Unit (or ReLu). All it does is $\\text{ReLu}(x)$ turns the number into zero if its negative, otherwise it leaves it alone.  This little ReLu turns two linear models into a very simple neural net. \n",
    "\n",
    "The genius of this is that instead of fitting a line to data, we can fit several layers of Linear/ReLus to achieve a very precise function. Most data won't be fit well by a linear model. However, almost all data can be fit by some arbitrarily large combination of linear models and ReLus.\n"

    "Did we meet our goal? We wanted to classify digits in the MNIST dataset more accurately than our baseline of ~83%. We beat it immediately with our first ML model in around 2-3 epochs with 90%. We then optimized our code and got 92% accuracy. We used the simplest possible deep learning model, a 2-layer neural net with a non-linear activation, and got 96% accuracy. Then we used a more standard deep learning model, resnet 18, and got 98% accuracy in only one epoch. Granted, this last training took longer than the others. \n",

    "\n",
    "Ok so we learned a lot. \n",
    "\n",
    "* Saw the difference in performance between baseline, ML, and DL\n",
    "* Learned how to format data and optimize code.\n",
    "* Got a grounding in the mathematical principles of ML and DL\n",
    "\n",
    "This was a hard project for me and I'm glad I finished. The hardest part was writing the code from scratch. Hopefully I never have to do that again, but at least I know I can if necessary. It's pretty amazing to think about the potential of activating deep learning models on all sorts of intriguing datasets!"
