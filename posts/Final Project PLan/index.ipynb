What if you could look at the digital patterns of your own life; the music you stream, the websites you browse, the videos that resonate... and in so doing see a real, data-driven reflection of your well-being? Almost like a personal check-engine light.\n",

    "## Second Brain PC\n",
    "No, I don't have the tech to literally build another brain. The project name is based off of a concept from author Tiago Forte called [Building a Second Brain](https://www.amazon.com/Building-Second-Brain-Organize-Potential/dp/1982167386?_encoding=UTF8&qid=1659288759&sr=8-1&linkCode=ll1&tag=fortelabs07-20&linkId=908faa5e398610c44e8bc19b8b148ade&language=en_US). In the book, he talks about creating an organized system of creativity, summarizing concepts from thought leaders like Octavia Butler, David Allen, and Richard Feynman. He mentions that at times of great transition, great thinkers like Locke and DaVinci kept \"commonplace books\" that allowed them to make sense of what was happening around them. I've been using this system for 2.5 years and here's a snapshot of some of today's fruit:"

    "\n",
    "A few months after implementing the PARA (FRAN) system, I also started archiving all of my digital files across time. Google Takeout, old computers, and I even downloaded a low-data backup of wikipedia. I built a webscraper that allowed me to download data from one of my favorite [podcasts](https://bibleproject.com/podcasts/the-bible-project-podcast/). They provide free resources that are already paid for by their community, so it didn't feel like an ethics breach to download these. I started realizing the need to have some type of local server to help me with data collection. \n",

    "This January I started spec-ing out an AI PC. I wanted to get an NVIDIA 5090 and was tenth in line at microcenter for release; apparently they only had five ðŸ˜­. Fortunately, one of the guys in line sold me a cheap 3090. I really wanted to be able to use some open-source models with my data, but not have to upload my data to anyone else's platform. I realized I was making a much bigger system than I originally thought. \n",
    "\n",
    "I gutted my old PC and redesigned it with Deep Learning in mind (Ryzen 7 5700x, 64 GB RAM, NVIDIA 3090). I knew it didn't have to be INCREDIBLY powerful, just enough to do some local image generation and run some local models; I've even had some rudimentary video generation. The problem is, whenever I ran those it maxed the VRAM used on the box. I'd need another machine to handle things like API calls and run \"always-on\" code, so I purchased a cheap NUC to handle this for me. \n",
    "\n",
    "I've always struggled to organize my data across platforms! I wanted to *harmonize* my data and so I realized that a single point of truth would be most effective. I researched local ways of implementing this and discovered that Seafile and NextCloud were the best options. I went with NextCloud because based on the file storage method, it was way easier to interact with local files than the other option. \n",
    "\n",
    "As of right now, I have almost everything set up. I have a cloud backup service, and a local backup or two. I'm planning to work with a friend who does security red-teaming for \"Big Tech\" to help me make it more secure. The docker setup and nextcloud have been a bit finnicky, but everything is generally organized. My vision was something like JARVIS from Iron Man; at least, one that never turns into a synthezoid.\n",

    "\n",
    "I got my wrapped playlist from 2023 in December, and I was noticed how my top songs were suspiciously correlated to the things that had happened that year. I wondered if my spotify data could somehow be used for personal insight. There's something incredibly powerful about leveraging data in this way! If I just take a survey, I might see the questions and engineer a response that I think someone wants to hear. I am incredibly honest with spotify about what I want to never listen; I never choose to listen to something I don't want to hear. I downloaded my data and did a brief proof of concept:"

    "I credit the majority of this post to my Second Brain system. It's been amazing to watch an idea develop from a tiny seed/bullet point into something fully fledged like what I'm about to describe. I've known I've needed to make a final project idea to finish the [FastAI part 1](https://course.fast.ai/Lessons/lesson1.html) course for a few months now. Originally I wanted to see if I could use my headspace data and my fitbit heart rate to see if I could predict when I'm meditating based on my heart rate. If so, I wouldn't need to rely on my headspace data, I'd just be able to extrapolate it from my heart rate data. \n",

    "I've wanted an automated way to track \"how I'm doing\". People sometimes say, \"Hey, how are you?\" and I don't always know how to respond. Sometimes I think I'm doing great but I'm really not. If I could create some type of data-driven Personal Wellness Index based on my actions, it might be really helpful. So the question I'd be using ML/AI to answer would be, \"What digitally recorded habits predict my highest positive experiences\". I already know my daily listening marginally correlates; what else could help me see myself more clearly?\n",
    "\n",
    "Of course, if you want to use ML to do this, you need to somehow label the data. Happy is a pretty arbitrary adjective to measure with data. *Fortunately, I've been keeping a daily Examen every day since mid-December.* If you haven't heard of it, it's essentially a prayerful daily review focusing on the most significant emotional/spiritual occurrences of the day. So theoretically I'd be able to use this to create a metric to optimize for. At the very least, I could use an LLM to analyze all of these and predict a \"consolation/desolation metric\" for each day; a number between -2 and 2. From there, I'd be able to leverage ALL my data and optimize some type og PWI. When I say ALL, this includes (but is not limited to):\n",
